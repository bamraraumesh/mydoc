1. Set up a Git repository: Initialize a Git repository on your local machine by navigating to your website's root directory and running the command `git init`. This will create a new Git repository to track your changes.

2. Add and commit your files: Use the command `git add .` to stage all files in your website directory for committing. Then, run `git commit -m "Initial commit"` to commit the changes with a descriptive message.

3. Create a remote repository: If you haven't already, create a remote repository on GitHub. Go to GitHub's website, log in to your account, and click on the "New" button to create a new repository. Follow the instructions to set it up, providing a name and optional description.

4. Connect your local repository to the remote: After creating the remote repository, link it to your local repository by running the command `git remote add origin <repository_url>`. Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository. This establishes the connection between your local Git repository and the remote repository on GitHub.

5. Push your files git push origin masterto GitHub: Use the command `git push -u origin master` to push your local repository's contents to the remote repository on GitHub. This command pushes the changes from your local `master` branch to the `master` branch on GitHub. If you're using a different branch, adjust the branch name accordingly.

6. Set up your server: Follow the server setup instructions provided by your hosting provider. Make sure you have access credentials (such as SSH) to connect to the server.

7. Connect to the server: Use an SSH client (e.g., PuTTY) to connect to your server using the provided access credentials. This will give you command-line access to the server.

8. Clone your repository: On the server, run the command `git clone <repository_url>` to clone your GitHub repository onto the server. Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository.

9. Configure the web server: Set up the web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) to point to the cloned repository's directory as the web root. This step ensures that the server serves your website files from the correct location.

10. Test your website: Access your website's URL in a web browser to verify that it's live. If there are any issues, check the server logs or configuration files for potential errors.

11. Deploy updates: Whenever you make changes to your website locally, commit and push those changes to GitHub using the commands `git add .`, `git commit -m "Commit message"`, and `git push origin <branch_name>`. Then, log in to your server via SSH and navigate to the cloned repository's directory. Run `git pull origin <branch_name>` to pull the latest changes from GitHub and update your website.

Using Git and GitHub provides version control and allows for easy collaboration with a team. It's important to note that this process assumes you have a server set up with Git installed. If your server does not have Git, you may need to consult your hosting provider or manually upload your files using FTP or other methods.
