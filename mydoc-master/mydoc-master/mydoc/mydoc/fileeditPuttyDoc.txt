A closure is a feature of JavaScript that allows inner functions to access the 
outer scope of a function. 
Closure helps in binding a function to its outer boundary and is created automatically
 whenever a function is created. A block is also treated as a scope since ES6. 
Since JavaScript is event-driven so closures are useful as it helps to maintain 
the state between events.

Prerequisite:: Variable Scope in JavaScript 

Lexical Scoping: A function scope’s ability to access variables from the parent scope
 is known as lexical scope. We refer to the parent function’s lexical binding of 
the child function as “lexically binding.”

Let’s see and understand closure through an example.
